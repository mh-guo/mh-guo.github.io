I am Minghao Guo (郭明浩), a final year graduate student at the <a href="https://web.astro.princeton.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University</a>, supervised by Profs. [James Stone](https://www.ias.edu/scholars/stone) and [Eliot Quataert](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~quataert/). I am also a visiting graduate student at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/) and a member of the [Learning the Universe (LtU) collaboration](https://learning-the-universe.org). I received my B.S. in Physics from [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2021.

My thesis work focuses on multiscale multiphase modeling on black hole accretion and feedback across a vast range of spatial and temporal scales in (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD/GRMHD) simulations. Simply using GRMHD simulations that resolve horizon to compute the feedback from the black hole to galactic scales is generally infeasible due to the very restrictive time step constraints ($$\gtrsim 9$$ orders of magnetidue!). To tackle this problem, we develop a series of methods to accelerate the GRMHD simulations by $$\gtrsim 10^5$$ times for problems with large scale separation and apply it to various problems that need to cover vast spatial and temporal scales. I'm also working on a wide range of topics including supernova remnants, feeding circumbinary disk, observation within Bondi radius, wandering massive black holes, etc.

I love sharing our wonderful universe to the public, and I give outreach talks at [Astronomy On Tap Trenton](https://astronomyontap.org) and teach astronomy in the [Prison Teaching Initiative](https://mcgraw.princeton.edu/community-college-engagement/prison-teaching-initiative). Outside academia, I like the nature in general (climbing, hiking, swimming, gardening, etc).

Last updated July, 2025.

Research
======

I am a computational astrophysicist with wide interests in theoretical, numerical, and observational astrophysics and a broad background in mathematics and computer science. I am attracted by a variety of intriguing topics in astronomy and astrophysics, especially black hole astrophysics, galaxy formation, cosmology, gravitational wave and gravity test. I generally use theoretical model and numerical techniques ([AthenaK](https://github.com/IAS-Astrophysics/athenak)) to investigate the abundant phenomenon in various fields in astrophysics. I have experience on doing research involving black hole accretion and feedback, coevolution between supermassive black holes and host galaxies, supernova remnants, multiphase interstellar medium, modified gravity theories, etc.

My research interests include:
- Black holes, high energy astrophysics, accretion disk, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD)
- Active galactic nuclei (AGN), galaxy formation and evolution, multiphase interstellar medium (ISM)
- Numerical methods and simulations, GPU computing, new numerical techniques
- Neutron stars, pulsars, gravitational waves, modified gravity theory

![Cyclic Zoom](/images/fig_cyclic_zoom_method.png)

We present a "cyclic zoom" method to capture the dynamics of accretion flows onto black holes across a vast range of spatial and temporal scales in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. In this method, we cyclically zoom out (derefine) and zoom in (refine) the simulation domain while using a central mask region containing a careful treatment of the coarsened fluid variables to preserve the small-scale physics, particularly the magnetic field dynamics. The method can accelerate GRMHD simulations by $$\gtrsim 10^5$$ times for problems with large scale separation. We demonstrate the validity of the technique using a series of tests, including spherically symmetric Bondi accretion, the Blandford-Znajek monopole, magnetized turbulent Bondi accretion, accretion of a magnetized rotating torus, and the long-term evolution of an accreting torus about both Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. As applications, we simulate Bondi and rotating torus accretion onto black holes from galactic scales, covering an extremely large dynamic range. In Bondi accretion, the accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate by $$\sim(10r_\mathrm{g}/r_\mathrm{B})^{1/2}$$ with a feedback power of $$\sim 0.01 \dot{M} c^2$$ for vanishing spin, and $$\sim 0.1 \dot{M} c^2$$ for spin $$a\approx0.9$$. In the long-term evolution of a rotating torus, the accretion rate decreases with time as $$\dot{M}\propto t^{-2}$$ on timescales much longer than the viscous timescale, demonstrating that our method can capture not only quasi-steady problems but also secular evolution. Our new method likewise holds significant promise for applications to many other problems that need to cover vast spatial and temporal scales.

  <figcaption> Zoom-in MHD simulations of black hole accretion from galaxy down to event horizon.</figcaption>
</figure>

We use a series of zoom-in MHD simulations that cover the entire range from galaxy formation down to the event horizon of black holes. We model the fueling of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies from a turbulent medium on galactic scales, taking M87* as a typical case. The simulations use AthenaK, a new GPU-accelerated version of the Athena++ AMR code. The key physical ingredients are magnetic field, radiative cooling and a phenomenological heating model. In this way, we can model the accretion onto supermassive black holes using realistic initial conditions, which aims to study the coevolution between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. The scaling of $$\dot{M} \sim r^{1/2}$$ roughly holds from $$\sim 10\,\mathrm{pc}$$ to $$\sim 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{pc}$$ ($$\sim 10\, r_\mathrm{g}$$) with the accretion rate through the event horizon being $$\sim 10^{-2}\, M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$$. The accretion flow on scales $$\sim 0.03-3\,\mathrm{kpc}$$ takes the form of magnetized filaments. Within $$\sim 30\,\mathrm{pc}$$, the cold gas circularizes, forming a highly magnetized ($$\beta\sim 10^{-3}$$) thick disk supported by a primarily toroidal magnetic field. The cold disk is truncated and transitions to a turbulent hot accretion flow at $$\sim0.3\,\mathrm{pc}$$ ($$10^3\,r_\mathrm{g}$$). There are strong outflows towards the poles driven by the magnetic field. The outflow energy flux increases with smaller accretor size, reaching $$\sim 3\times10^{43}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$$ for $$r_\mathrm{in}=8\,r_\mathrm{g}$$; this corresponds to a nearly constant energy feedback efficiency of $$\eta\sim0.05-0.1$$ independent of accretor size. The feedback energy is enough to balance the total cooling of the M87/Virgo hot halo out to $$\sim 50$$ kpc. The accreted magnetic flux at small radii is similar to that in magnetically arrested disk models, consistent with the formation of a powerful jet on horizon scales in M87. Our results motivate a subgrid model for accretion in lower-resolution simulations in which the hot gas accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate by $$\sim (10r_\mathrm{g}/r_\mathrm{B})^{1/2}$$.

 We find that the accretion flow takes the form of multiphase gas at radii less than about a kpc. The cold gas accretion includes two dynamically distinct stages: the typical disk stage in which the cold gas resides in a rotationally supported disk and relatively rare chaotic stages ($$ \lesssim 10\% $$ of the time) in which the cold gas inflows via chaotic streams. Though cold gas accretion dominates the time-averaged accretion rate at intermediate radii, accretion at the smallest radii is dominated by hot virialized gas at most times.

[Idealized accretion disks with strong toroidal magnetic fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12671)

![Magnetized disk](/images/fig_mdisk_slice.png)

We present global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of accretion disks with a strong toroidal magnetic field using an equation of state that fixes the gas thermal scale height. The disk forms from the inflow of a rotating magnetized gas cloud with a toroidal magnetic field. We find that the system maintains a moderately strong mean azimuthal field in the midplane, with plasma $$\beta \sim 1$$, trans-Alfvénic fluctuations, and large accretion stresses $$\alpha\sim0.1$$. The azimuthal field in the disk is continuously escaping along the vertical direction but is also replenished via a local dynamo. The inflowing gas initially forms a strongly magnetized Keplerian disk with $$\beta\ll1$$ and $$\alpha \gg 1$$. The disk gradually collapses from the inside out over $$\sim 50-80$$ orbits to form a moderately magnetized disk with $$\beta\sim1$$ and $$\alpha\sim0.1$$. Radial advection of azimuthal magnetic field can maintain $$\beta\lesssim1$$ exterior to the circularization radius but not inside of it. Inclusion of a net initial vertical magnetic field can lead to an even more strongly magnetized disk midplane, consistent with previous work. When the gas thermal scale is not resolved ($$\lesssim 4$$ cells per thermal scale height), however, the disk remains highly magnetized with $$\beta \ll 1 $$. We discuss our results in the context of related shearing box simulations and other global disk simulations. The level of angular momentum transport found here is consistent with that inferred observationally in dwarf novae and X-ray transient outbursts, unlike simulations of weakly magnetized accretion disks.

[Supernova remnant in a cloudy multiphase interstellar medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12809)
------

![Supernova remnant](/images/fig_snr_render_cut.png)

We investigate the evolution of supernova remnants (SNRs) in a two-phase cloudy medium by performing a series of high-resolution (up to $$\Delta x\approx0.01\,\mathrm{pc}$$), 3D hydrodynamical simulations including radiative cooling and thermal conduction. We aim to reach a resolution that directly captures the shock-cloud interactions for the majority of the clouds initialized by the saturation of thermal instability. In comparison to the SNR in a uniform medium with the volume filling warm medium, the SNR expands similarly (following $$\propto t^{2/5}$$) but sweeps up more mass as the cold clouds contribute before shocks in the warm medium become radiative. However, the SNR in a cloudy medium continuously loses energy after shocks toward the cold clouds cool, resulting in less hot gas mass, thermal energy, and terminal momentum. Thermal conduction has little effect on the dynamics of the SNR but smooths the morphology and modifies the internal structure by increasing the density of hot gas by a factor of $$\sim 3-5$$. The simulation results are not fully consistent with many previous 1D models describing the SNR in a cloudy medium including a mass loading term. By direct measurement in the simulations, we find that, apart from the mass source, the energy sink is also important with a spatially flat cooling rate $$\dot{e}\propto t^{-11/5}$$. As an illustration, we show an example 1D model including both mass source and energy sink terms (in addition to the radiative cooling in the volume filling component) that better describes the structure of the simulated SNR.

See below for the 3D structure (model available at [Sketchfab](https://skfb.ly/oBVz9)).

![STGROMX](/images/fig_stgromx.png)

We investigated a scalar-tensor gravity theory proposed by Damour and Esposito-Farèse (DEF) that predicts large deviations from General Relativity for neutron stars through spontaneous scalarization phenomena. I constructed reduced-order surrogate model for the derived quantities in this theory, coded in a python package [pySTGROMX](https://github.com/AstroMG/pySTGROMX) that speeds up calculations at two orders of magnitude yet still keeps accuracy, compared with the previous algorithms. As an application, we utilized [pySTGROMX](https://github.com/AstroMG/pySTGROMX) to explore constraints on the DEF theory with latest well-timed binary pulsars and gravitational waves through Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The work is summarized in  a first-author paper published in the Physical Review D.

![Wandering BH](/images/fig_wandering_BH.png)

In the Λ-cold dark matter universe, frequent galaxy mergers and the subsequent central BH interactions would probably create a population of wandering BHs. We investigated low-density accretion flows onto massive black holes orbiting around in the outskirts of their host galaxies (e.g., massive ellipticals, Milky Way, dwarf galaxies), performing three-dimensional simulations and semi-analytical calculations. We constructed radiative inefficient accretion-flow models for accretion near the horizon of a black hole, applied the simulation results to the emission model, and calculated the spectral energy distribution for the accretion flow onto a wandering black hole. We studied the detectability of wandering (super-massive) black holes in different types of galaxies, predicting that ALMA will enable us to hunt for a population of wandering BHs.

![Bulge Formation](/images/fig_bulge_formation.png)

We studied real and simulated galaxies from both observational and dynamical points of view. Through morphological decomposition for the structures of the galaxy models in N-body simulations using IRAF and GALFIT, I investigated the long-term evolution of barred galaxies with growth of central BHs. We demonstrated that the destruction of short bar contributes significantly to the growth of the bulge which finally bears many similarities to a classical bulge in terms of observation. These results have important implications for the secular evolution of active galaxies and the effect of BH growth in shaping the inner structures of galaxies.
